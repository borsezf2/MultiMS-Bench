# Faults in Microservices: Empirical Analysis and Quantitative Impact

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Microservices architectures have transformed modern software engineering, enabling modular, scalable, and resilient application designs. However, they introduce new challenges in fault detection, failure propagation, and system-wide resilience.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Despite their benefits, microservices are prone to a variety of failures, including high-latency responses, cascading failures, and security vulnerabilities. These failures impact:

1. **End Users** – Reduced usability, broken features, and degraded experience.
2. **Business Operations** – Downtime, revenue loss, and SLA violations.
3. **Engineers & Developers** – Complex debugging, high MTTR, and operational overhead.

### 1.3 Research Scope & Objectives

This report aims to:

- Analyze **real-world microservice failures** across industries.
- Categorize faults and **quantify** their impact.
- Examine **detection & mitigation** strategies with empirical benchmarks.
- Present **industry best practices** for resilience.
